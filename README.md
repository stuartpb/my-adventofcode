# My Advent of Code solutions

These are my [Advent of Code][] scripts.

[Advent of Code]: https://adventofcode.com/

The Lua scripts are written for Lua 5.3, and generally take the input on stdin (per-day README files will note exceptions).

All input is expected to end with a newline at end of file, though all scripts should still work when that's not the case.

## Wrong answers

Some days include a "wrong" directory: this contains scripts that misread the question, and only produce valid output by that differing interpretation.

## Why do the daily readmes?

They make it easier to search for a previously-solved problem, by picking keywords that might not have been in the problem as described.
