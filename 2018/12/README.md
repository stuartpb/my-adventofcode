# Advent of Code 2018, Day 12: Flowerpot Generations

https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/12

## Synopsis

Given a set of progression rules for a 1D cellular automata, find the sum of all occupied positions after twenty (Part 1) and fifty billion (Part 2) iterations.

## Problems

I had trouble understanding that the sum being asked for is the sum of *the numbers of the pots*, not the number of flowers (even adding up all the past flowers in the example, the sum was only 264).

I also ran into trouble because I was counting for 5 billion generations in Part 2 instead of 50 billion (it had been a while since I checked the question).
