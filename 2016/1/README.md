# Advent of Code 2016, Day 1: Grid Walking

https://adventofcode.com/2016/day/1

## Synopsis

We're finding Easter Bunny HQ by going left or right and then straight a number of paces.

Part 1 counts the ending distance from the origin.

Part 2 finds the first self-intersecting point on the path.

## Wrong versions

I originally read Part 2 as using the first *point* that was visited twice, ie. a point where we made a turn.
