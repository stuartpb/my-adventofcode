# Advent of Code 2016, Day 2: The Bathroom Code

https://adventofcode.com/2016/day/2

## Synopsis

We're finding the digits to hit by following directions ('U', 'D', 'L', and 'R' for up/down/left/right) from a starting button on a keypad.

Part 1 uses a simple 1-9 keypad; the version here just thinks in terms of digit changes.

Part 2 uses a more complex keypad, the geometry of which we do actually simulate.
