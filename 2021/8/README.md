# Advent of Code 2021, Day 8: Seven-Segment Displays

https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/8

## Synopsis

Given a list of all seven-segment display sets for each digit (per line), determine which sets correspond to which digits, then total up all the 4-digit numbers represented at the end of each line.

Part 1, as a warmup to the idea of the puzzle, just has us totalling up the number of digits that are identified by their unique segment count (1, 4, 7, and 8).
