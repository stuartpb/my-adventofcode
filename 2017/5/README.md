# Advent of Code 2017, Day 5: Jumps to Escape Instruction List

https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/5

## Synopsis

Given an input list of position jumps, where each jump increments the offset defined at that position by 1:

Part 1 prints total jumps to leave the defined list.

Part 2 prints total jumps to leave the defined list when offsets of 3 or more decrement instead of incrementing.
