# Advent of Code 2017, Day 3: Spiral Memory

https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/3

## Synopsis

On a spiral memory buffer:

Part 1 prints the distance of a given position.

Part 2 prints the sum of adjacent cells.

## Artifacts

A little sketch I made trying to work out the math for my constant-space Part 1 solution:

```
 3   2   1   0   1   2   3
37  36  35  34  33  32  31 3
38  17  16  15  14  13  30 2
39  18   5   4   3  12  29 1
40  19   6   1   2  11  28 0
41  20   7   8   9  10  27 1
42  21  22  23  24  25  26 2
43  44  45  46  47  48  49
```
