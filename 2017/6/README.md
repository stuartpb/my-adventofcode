# Advent of Code 2017, Day 6: Memory Reallocation

https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/6

## Synopsis

Given an input list of allocations within 16 banks, we determine how long until a balancing algorithm will reach a prior state (Part 1), and then how long it will be until we cycle back to that state (Part 2).
