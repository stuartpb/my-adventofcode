# Advent of Code 2017, Day 12: Pipe Groups

https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/12

## Synopsis

Given a list of edges, find the number of nodes connected to node 0 (Part 1) and the number of groups (Part 2).

## Implementation

I was initially thinking something like a union find strategy (having seen Problem 2 on LeetCode as [Number of Provinces][]), but after thinking about it for a few seconds, I decided the simple parse-then-traverse strategies seen here were simpler.
