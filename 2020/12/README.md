https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/12

## Synopsis

Given a list of instructions, find the Manhattan distance of a point following those instructions (by more complicated rules in Part 2).

## Connections

Advent of Code 2016, Day 1 also consisted of a series of directions (only L and R) followed by distances.

A sequence of instructions that modify the target for a ship in Part 2 is also used for 2021 Day 1.
