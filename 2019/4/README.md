# Advent of Code 2019, Day 4: Valid Passcodes in Range

https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/4

## Synopsis

The input here is a range of two numbers (on one line, separated by a hyphen), where a "password" can be any number in that range whose decimal form has a pair of repeated digits, and all digits from left to right are increasing or equal.

Part 1 prints the total of all of these where the "pair" can repeat more than once; Part 2 requires a pair of exactly 2.
